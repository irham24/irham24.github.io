These include the David Rumsey Map Collection, The New York Public Library, Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library, Universiteit Leiden, Utrecht University Library, staremapy.cz and the Old Maps Online search engine.<br><br>From these maps, I wondered how the maps would look when compared with younger maps side by side. So that it can be seen the difference in visualization, cartography, and toponymy of the map."

This project was created using Unreal Engine and Vue.js. The data used in this project is data that is shared publicly through the jakarta satu website. The building models visualized in this digital twin are mostly the result of AI generation from 2D spatial vector data."
