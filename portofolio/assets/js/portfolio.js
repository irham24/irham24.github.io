Curious about the monthly workload of firefighters, I looked and obtained rescue data from the Depok Fire Department for December 2023. My aim for this project is to analyze and visualize this data using Geopandas. From this analysis, I got several insights, including case distribution maps, daily case data, and a breakdown of cases by category."

So that it can be seen the difference in visualization, cartography, and toponymy of the map."

This behavior made me think: can social media data be used to determine the potential of tourism?<br><br>Because the data I wanted was about tourist potential, I chose Instagram as a data source. Data was downloaded using the Instagram developer API that was provided officially by Instagram. I downloaded the latest Instagram post data for 1.5 months (mid-December until February) using a Python script.<br><br>The data that has been downloaded is then selected spatially and content with the intended tourist location. The data is then visualized using a heatmap."
